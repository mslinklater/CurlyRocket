How To Play
===========

1)

Minesweeper is a puzzle game where you try to find and put flags on the mines.

You find the flags by clearing the play area and deducing where the mines must be.

2)

Squares with mines as neighbors contain a number. This number shows how many mines are neighbors of the square.

(eg) - 1 mine

---

3)

To clear a square, tap it. WARNING - if you tap on a square with a mine in it, that is game over.

4)

When you work out where a mine is, don't tap it - hold your finger on it to put a flag on it instead.

(eg) - 1 mine with flag on the mine

---

5)

eg 2 - multiple mines

---

6)

Things can get quite complicated... but with a little practice you'll get the hang of it.

(eg) - complex example

Curly Minesweeper helps you out in three ways

[three]

---

8)

First, pressing the 'Recon' button will start you off on a new map without you risking hitting
a mine accidentaly.

9)

Secondly, if you get stuck you can press the 'Hint' button, and see where the mines are.

Thirdly, if you make a mistake you can Undo your last move.

[doh!]

11)

Using aids costs you coins. You start off with 10 free coins
and if you want some more you need to buy them. You can play Curly Minesweeper without
using coins, but you won't be able to use the aids.

12)

Buying coins is how I can afford to make games. Curly Minesweeper is free, and even 
game developers need to eat 8)
